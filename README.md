* In this project I have created a system in which we have to make folder in which this script is then run code.
* It will ask you with different options like register, change username , change password using otp or change password using old password.
* When we use otp to change password otp is sent to reciever email address with otp and if entered otp matches the sended otp your password will change.
  * But for this we have to enable two step verification on our receiver email id and also have to create app password as added in comment in script.
